                    There are 8 JavaScript data types (you learned about 7 of them for homework). 7
                    <code>primitive</code> types, and one <code>object</code> type.

                <p>
                    Primitive data types (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that has no object and no
                    methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are <code>7 primitive data types</code> in <code>JavaScript</code>: <code>string</code>,
                    <code>boolean</code>,
                    <code>number</code>, <code>bigInt</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>null</code>, and
                    <code>undefined</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All <code>primitive data types</code> are <i>immutable</i>. They cannot be changed. The
                    <b>variable</b> that hold
                    the <b>primitive value</b> can be <i>re-assigned</i> another <b>value</b>, but the
                    <b><i>value</i></b> <b>itself</b>
                    <i>cannot be changed</i> in the ways that <code>objects</code>, <code>functions</code>, and
                    <code>arrays</code> can
                    be <i>changed</i>.

                <h2>Primitive JavaScript Data Types: string</h2>
                <p>
                    The string primitive data type, which you have already encountered, looks like so:
                </p>
                <code>'Maria'</code> or <code>"Maria"</code> or <code>`Maria`</code>.
                <p>
                    string is used to represent text data. Each string is made up of a <code>set</code> of "elements" of
                    16-bit unsigned
                    integer values (the indexes). That means that each element occupies a position in the String. The
                    first element is
                    at index 0, the second at index 1, etc. The length of the String is the number of elements in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript strings are immutable. Once created, they cannot be changed. BUT, it is possible to
                    create another string
                    based on an operation on the original string: a substring of the original by using
                    <code>String.substr()</code> or
                    concatenating strings with <code>String.concat()</code>.
                </p>

                    Show primitive data type string in action in JS playground. Show how trying to change the string
                    directly fails, mutating an array by pushing a string value into it does work, because not mutating
                    the string. Mutating the array. And then show re-assigning the variable holding the string value can
                    result in a different string value. But only then.

                        <code>+ 0</code>. <code>0</code> is an alias for <code>+0</code>. This usually does not matter,
                        as <code>-0 ===
                            +0</code>. The only time you might notice something different is when you divide by 0.

                        In JavaScript, objects can be regarded as a collection of properties.

                    <li>
                        With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties can be intialized, then later

                    <li>
                        Property values can be of any type or other objects. This means being able to build complex data

                        Properties are defined using key values. A key <i>value</i> is either a String or a Symbol

                    not on an instance of type Object. We'll get into that more later when we get deeper into the object

                    <li>
                        Arrays are regular objects in which there is a relationship between integer-keyed properties and
                        the length
                        property. Remember that with Strings there is just the length property!

                    <li>
                        Arrays inherit from Array.proptotype, which means they have access to a bunch of convenient
                        built in methods to
                        manipulate arrays. Examples are indexOf(), searching a value in the array, push(), adding an
                        element to the
                        array. This makes Arrays great for representing lists or sets.

                    <li>
                        Typed Arrays are new to JavaScript in ECMAScript 2015, and are array-like objects that provide a
                        mechanism for
                        reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers.

                    <li>
                        Array objects grow and become smaller dynamically and can have any JavaScript value. JavaScript
                        engines (i.e.,
                        V8 Engine) perform optimizations so that these arrays are fast.

                        However, when web applications become bigger and bigger and more and more powerful, adding
                        things like video and
                        audio manipulations, access to raw data using WebSockets(i.e. for live chat), it became evident
                        that it would be
                        great to make JavaScript able to quickly and easily manipulate raw binary data. This where typed
                        arrays come in.
